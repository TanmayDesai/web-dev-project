                        Poco launched their second phone today (for 2020) in India. It is called the Poco M2 Pro. The terrible naming scheme aside, Poco M2 Pro is what the Redmi Note 9 Pro should have been in the first place. It is very confusing as to what Xiaomi and Poco are up to with their phones this year.

                        Global Redmi K30 was launched in India as Poco X2, and now the global Redmi Note 9 Pro is launched in India as the Poco M2 Pro. All this re-branding makes things complicated, and frankly hurts the brand image of Poco. Let me explain.
                        <h2>Display</h2>
                        The Poco M2 Pro flaunts a massive 6.67-inch LCD display with FUll HD+ resolution of 2400x1080 pixels. The display offers a pixel density of 395 PPI and it works fine under direct sunlight. The refresh rate is fixed at 60Hz, which is good for regular usage as it saves battery but all-day gamers may miss 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate displays.
For the price you are paying, you will be mighty pleased with the overall display quality. The colours are vivid along with good contrast ratio and viewing angles. Watching movies and playing games on the Poco M2 Pro is a delight. Not to forget, there is a night mode and reading mode as well to comfort your eyes.
                        <h2>Camera</h2>
                        On to the optics, the M2 Pro offers a quad-camera array with ba 48MP primary snapper with f/1.79, an 8MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera, a 5MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. Over at the front, you get a 16MP shooter. You can record up to 4K videos with the rear camera and the front camera supports night mode capture too.
                        <h2>Specifications</h2>
                        The Poco M2 Pro features a 6.67-inch Full HD+ IPS LCD screen with a punch-hole camera placed at the centre of the screen. It brings a familiar design with a Gorilla Glass 5 sandwich that protects the front, back as well as the camera. Under the hood, the device is powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 720G processor and Adreno 618 GPU. The device is available in three configurations: 4+64GB, 6+64GB, and 6+128GB. You also get a MicroSD card slot. 
                        <h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
                        In India, the Poco M2 Pro is priced at Rs 13,999 for the base variant with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM, Rs 14,999 for the 6GB + 64GB variant and Rs 16,999 for the 6GB + 128GB model. Colour options include Two Shades of Black, Green and Greener and Out of the Blue. It will be available for purchase on Flipkart.
