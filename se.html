                    <h2>iPhone SE 2020 Design</h2>
                    Let’s start by talking about the design. Although it is the iPhone SE “2020”, the design is actually several years old. Those huge bezels upfront look really bad and outdated.

I don’t know why apple couldn’t just shrink the bezels a bit so that this phone would look more like a 2020 modern smartphone. Anyway, a plus point to having those huge bezels is the return of the home button along with Touch ID.


 
So yeah, Touch ID is back and I am really happy about it. I would any day pick a good fingerprint sensor over something like face unlock or Face ID.

The iPhone SE is a small phone and we finally have a good small factor phone with an awesome camera and modern specifications. Yay!

                    <h2>iPhone SE 2020 Build Quality</h2>
                    As far as the build goes, iPhone SE 2020 comes with a glass sandwich design. This means, glass on the front and back with an aluminium frame.


 
The build of the phone seems pretty good and no complaints over there. iPhone SE 2020 is also IP67 rated for water and dust resistance. That means it will be protected from water up to 1 meter for 30 minutes.

                    <h2>Display</h2>
                    The display on iPhone SE 2020 is a 4.7″ Retina HD Display which means it is and IPS LCD Display with a resolution just over 720p. 1334-by-750-pixel resolution at 326 ppi

Yeah, 720p in 2020. Never thought I’ll hear that.

Honestly I am a little disappointed with the display resolution. But with that being said, I’m pretty sure that the display is going to be pretty good in terms of colour accuracy and viewing angles
                        <h2>specifications</h2>
                        iPhone SE 2020 comes with the same processor as the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro which is the Apple A13 Bionic. A13 Bionic chipset is based on the 7nm process and is a beast when it comes to performance.

iPhone SE 2020 is going to be a solid phone in terms of performance as it has a smaller display and less number of pixels to push. Also with iOS 13 the optimisation is going to be pretty good.
                        <h2>Camera</h2>
                        iPhone SE 2020 comes with a single rear camera and it is the same one as on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. Yes, the same primary camera of the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro which is excellent.


 
12MP Sensor with an aperture of f/1.8. It also has software portrait mode (for humans only). The camera is optically stabilised as well.

This camera can take some really awesome photos and it is going to be great for video as well. It can shoot 4K videos up to 60fps and slow motion 1080p video up to 240fps. iPhone SE 2020 is probably the best and cheapest phone for shooting high quality  videos
                        <h2>Pricing</h2>
                        iPhone SE 2020 starts at $399 for the 64GB variant. 

In India, the iPhone SE will start at ₹42,500.

All in all, the iPhone SE seems like a pretty solid and budget friendly iPhone for 2020.
